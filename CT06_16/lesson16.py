# # Lesson 16 - Turtle (Part 2)

# ## Recap 1: Quadruple the Number
# Create a function that takes in a number and quadruples it

# 1. Create a function named quadrupleNumber() that takes in 1 argument
# 2. The function should take in a number, and return the quadrupled
#    value of the number
# 4. Using the quadrupleNumber() function, print the quadruples of the
#    following numbers:
#     105 (ans: 420)
#     24 (ans: 96)
#     402 (ans: 1608)
#     594 (ans: 2376)

# ## Recap 2: Shape Creator
# You want to create a shape creator program that will draw any shape
# you want simply by giving the program the length and number of sides
# that the shape must have.

# To do this, you need to create a function with 2 parameters:
# 1. 'length'
# 2. 'num_sides'

# 1. Create a function called drawShape() that takes in the length
#    of the sides, as well as the number of sides.
# 2. The function should draw a shape with the length of sides and
#    the number of sides given
# 3. Using the shapeDrawer() function, draw the following:
# **Recap 2a**:
#     Square (4 sides)
# **Recap 2b**:
#     Hexagon (6 sides)
# **Recap 2c**:
#     Octagon (8 sides)

# Hint:
# The interior angle of a shape with n sides is given with the formula
# 180 - (360 / n)

# You may refer to the following as a guide:
# 1. Import 'turtle' library
# 2. Set up a window
# 3. Create a turtle object and lift the pen to move without drawing
# 4. Define 'drawShape' function to draw a regular polygon based on
#    specified length and number of sides

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# ## Recap 3: Drawing a house
# You have been tasked to draw a house (made of a square and a triangle)

# Using the 'drawShape' function you have just created, create a house
# by first drawing a square, then a triangle above the square.

# 1. The house is made up of a 100x100 square and a triangle that is
#    100 units long each side.
# 2. The triangle must be connected to the square

# You may refer to the following as a guide:
# 1. (Recap 2) - Import 'turtle' library
# 2. (Recap 2) - Set up a window
# 3. (Recap 2) - Create a turtle object and lift the pen to move
#    without drawing
# 4. (Recap 2) - Define 'drawShape' function to draw a regular polygon
#    based on specified length and number of sides
# 5. (NEW!) - Define 'drawHouse' function that uses the 'drawShape'
#    function to combine a square and a triangle

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# ## Recap 4: Drawing a town
# You would like to create a small town of houses.

# Modify your answer to the previous task by turning it into a new
# 'drawHouse()' function.

# Then using a nested 'for' loop and the 'drawHouse()' function that
# you have just created, draw a grid of 3 x 3 houses.

# You may refer to the following as a guide:
# 1. (Recap 2) - Import 'turtle' library
# 2. (NEW!) - Set up a 600x600 window
# 3. (Recap 2) - Create a turtle object and lift the pen to move
#    without drawing
# 4. (Recap 2) - Define 'drawShape' function to draw a regular polygon
#    based on specified length and number of sides
# 5. (Recap 3) - Define 'drawHouse' function that uses the 'drawShape'
#    function to combine a square and a triangle
# 6. (NEW!) - Move turtle to starting position at (-200,200)
# 7. (NEW!) - Use loops to draw a 3x3 grid of houses, moving the turtle
#    as needed between houses and rows

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# ## Task 1: Creating a turtle window
# By creating and using the following function, create a turtle window
# that is 300(w) x 500(h):

# setup_screen(screenWidth, screenHeight)
# * Returns a window that is screenWidth x screenHeight

# You will require the following:
# 1. import turtle
# 2. turtle.Screen()
# 3. .setup(width=???, height=???)
# 4. return
# 5. 'screenWidth' variable
# 6. 'screenHeight' variable

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# ## Task 2: Creating a turtle object
# By creating and using the following function, create a blue circular
# turtle object with its pen lifted:

# create_blue_ball()
# * Returns a blue circular turtle object with pen lifted

# You will require the following:
# 1. turtle.Turtle()
# 2. .shape()
# 3. .color()
# 4. .penup()
# 5. return

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# ## Task 3: Moving turtle object
# By creating and using the following function, move the turtle object
# by 'dx' and 'dy' in a forever loop:

# move_ball(ball, dx, dy)
# * Move ball by 'dx' and 'dy'

# You will require the following:
# 1. .setx()
# 2. .xcor()
# 3. .sety()
# 4. .ycor()
# 5. 'dx' variable
# 6. 'dy' variable

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------

# ## Task 4: Detecting edge
# **Task 4a: x-axis**
# By creating and using the following function, reverse the x-direction
# that the turtle object is moving when it touches the left/right side
# of the window:

# check_x(ball, screenWidth)
# * Returns 'True' if ball is beyond window in the x-axis

# You will require the following:
# 1. .xcor()
# 2. screenWidth/2
# 3. or
# 4. -screenWidth/2
# 5. *= -1

# **Task 4b: y-axis**
# By creating and using the following function, reverse the y-direction
# that the turtle object is moving when it touches the top/bottom side
# of the window:

# check_y(ball, screenHeight)
# * Returns 'True' if ball is beyond window in the y-axis

# You will require the following:
# 1. .ycor()
# 2. screenHeight/2
# 3. or
# 4. -screenHeight/2
# 5. *= -1
