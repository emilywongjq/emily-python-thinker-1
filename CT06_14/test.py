#Task 1
# Print numbers from 10 to 200 using the while loop
# Your numbers must be in multiples of 10.
# 10 must be first number printed, and 200 the last number.

# Example: 10, 20, 30 ..... 180, 190, 200.
# Note that the numbers do not need to be printed in one line.
# Write your code here:


# number = 10 #set the number to 10
# while number <= 200 :#it will only stop at 200
#     print(number) #print the number
#     number += 10 #interval of 10




# Task 2
# Code a password checker to protect your code!

# Assign a password "superpass123" to a variable
# Ask the user to enter a password
# If the password matches, print “Access Granted”
# If the password does not match, print “Access Denied”

# Write your code here:


# pwd = "superpass123" # setting the password

# user_input = input("What is the password?  : ") # ask the user for the password
# if user_input == pwd:
#     print("Access Granted") # Grant access because the question says so
# else:
#     print("Acces Denied") #  do not grant access because the question says so
